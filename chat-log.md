lizajane999: add this file to the project

GitHub Copilot: The file School.java already exists in your project. It currently contains a driver program for `Student` objects, not a `School` class with fields and methods.

Would you like me to:
- Replace the current contents with a `School` class definition (with fields like name, address, numStudents)?
- Or add a new class (e.g., `SchoolInfo.java`) for the `School` object, and keep School.java as your driver?

Please specify your preference.
